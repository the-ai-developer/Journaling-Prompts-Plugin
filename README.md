## What’s the Deal? 🌟
Picture this: you fire up Obsidian, and bam—Journaling Prompts Plugin greets you with a “Hello [Your Name]!” and questions like “How do I feel about social interactions?” (introvert vibes) or “Do I enjoy being the center of attention?” (extrovert energy). You jot down your thoughts, hit submit, and it’s all neatly saved. We’re prepping to add LLM magic to analyze your answers and drop wisdom like, “You’re thriving, but maybe recharge solo for a bit.” It’s journaling with a personal twist—Obsidian-style!

### Current Features 🔥
- **Personality-Based Prompts**: Pick introvert, extrovert, or ambivert—get questions that match your vibe.
- **Custom Name**: See a friendly “Hello [Your Name]!” in the modal.
- **Note Saving**: Answers land in a tidy `.md` file with a timestamp (e.g., `Journal-2025-02-22.md`).
- **Settings**: Tweak your name and personality type in a slick settings tab.
